# Blender-LightLinkCopy
Blender addon that copies light and shadow linking collections to selected lights. It can also be used to remove the assigned collections if the active light doesn't have any.

Location : Properties > Object > Shading > Light Link Copy

**NOTE**: This same function should become a part of Copy Attributes addon soon. When it does, if I don't forget, I'll remove this one.
